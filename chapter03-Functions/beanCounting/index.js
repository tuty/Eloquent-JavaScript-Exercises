/**
 * Bean counting
 You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".
 charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned
 value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"
 ). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to
 be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character
 string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
 Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and
 returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are
 in the string.
 Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except
 it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be
 counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite
 countBs to make use of this new function.
